      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am Sanjaay, also known as Whippingdot, which is my online persona! I
        am 13, and started coding when I was 11. I first had a website hosted
        with Weebly. That website is still up so you can still find it, but when
        my coding skills improved, I decided to create my own website from
        scratch!
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I code, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, and I also do other
        things like play the Piano & Keyboard, and play Football and Basketball.
        I am not that great in sports, but I aspire to improve in Basketball.

      <h2>Programming to Me</h2>
      <p>
        Python was the first language that I learnt, because it was recommended
        to me. I actually learnt python like 3 different times, because I kept
        on looking for new courses at that time and I could never choose on
        course to follow. Right now I use LinkedIn Learning and have been using
        it for a year, because it is my solid choice!
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I want to become a game designer when I grow up. This might seem
        childish but I love programming and I really like the game creating
        aspect of it. I am going to learn C# just because people say Unity is
        simpler than Unreal for beginners. Unreal will come after I master
        Unity!
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I also learned Web Development because I really like the concept of
        designing beautiful web pages that make people 'awh'! I am learning
        Node.js so I can use Express as a backend for my servers, and I learnt
        HTML, CSS, and Javascript because they are most commonly used in web
        dev.
