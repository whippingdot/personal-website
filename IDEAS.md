# Ideas

- Dark Mode
- Light / Dark Mode Toggle
- Navbar
- Constantly Updating Profile Picture

## Dark Mode

Have a dark mode toggle on the bottom right. Maybe find some way to use the transition property to have a smooth transition between dark and light mode...but I don't know if that is possible.

## Light / Dark Mode Toggle

Use icons for the dark mode toggle. Maybe don't even use a border, just use icons.

## Navbar

Have a navbar which links to the different sections of the website. Have a cool hover effect if possible too! Find a way to make it so that the links in the navbar don't reload the browser, but smoothly move to that section of the website.

## Constantly Updating Profile Picture

Using the Discord API, find a way to have your profile picture on the right side of the website which constantly updates whenever you update your Discord profile picture. A current method is to get the user object and obtain the pfp hash from that and append it to the link for Discord images and use that in the img src, but that seems very complex so if you find a simpler method that would be nice. Also, if this is to complex for you and there are no other methods just upload your profile picture and update that.
